# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using UCI Dataset

This project uses the **UCI Heart Disease dataset** to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on several medical attributes. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple machine learning models to provide accurate predictions.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Heart Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
- **Attributes:**
  - `age`: Age of the patient
  - `sex`: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
  - `cp`: Chest pain type (0–3)
  - `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
  - `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
  - `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
  - `restecg`: Resting ECG results (0, 1, 2)
  - `thalach`: Max heart rate achieved
  - `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
  - `oldpeak`: ST depression from exercise
  - `slope`: Slope of the ST segment
  - `ca`: Number of major vessels (0–3)
  - `thal`: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
  - `target`: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies whether a patient has heart disease based on their clinical features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (for optional UI)
